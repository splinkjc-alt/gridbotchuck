1/ GridBot Chuck is a multi-strategy trading bot for crypto & stocks.

Unlike most bots, I show EVERY trade - wins AND losses.

Day 1 results: $157 → $269.44 (+71.6%)
```

```
2/ What's included:

🔹 Grid Trading - profits from sideways markets
🔹 Triple-Threat - 3 strategies combined
🔹 Stock Bot - mean reversion scanner

Works on Kraken, Coinbase, & Alpaca.
```

```
3/ The code is 100% open source (MIT license).

You can inspect every line, modify it, use it commercially.

No hidden fees. No subscriptions (for now).

```

```
4/ Why am I doing this?

The algo trading space is FULL of scams.

I want to prove that transparent, honest bots can exist.

Follow along as I trade live & share real results. 📊

### r/passive_income

**Title:** Built an open-source trading bot - Day 1: +$112 (+71.6%)

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I've been working on a trading bot for the past few months and finally released it as open source.

**Day 1 Results:**
- Starting capital: $157
- Profit: +$112.44
- Return: +71.6%
- Time: 8.5 hours

**What it does:**
- Automatically buys low and sells high using grid levels
- Runs 24/7 (crypto markets never close)
- Works on Kraken, Coinbase, and Alpaca (stocks)
- Paper trading mode to test without risking money

**Why I'm sharing this:**
Most "trading bots" online are scams. I want to show that honest, transparent automation is possible.

**Link:** https://github.com/splinkjc-alt/gridbotchuck

**Important:** This is NOT guaranteed passive income. You CAN lose money. I recommend starting with paper trading and only risking what you can afford to lose.

Happy to answer questions!
