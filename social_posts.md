# GridBot Chuck - Social Media Posts

## Twitter/X (Short)

### Post 1 - The Hook
```
Building an open-source trading bot that optimizes itself for each coin.

No more one-size-fits-all settings.

BTC gets different indicators than DOGE. Because they trade differently.

### Post 2 - The Tech
```
What if your trading bot learned the best settings for EACH coin?

GridBot Chuck:
- Tests 4 timeframes x 5 indicator combos x 3 strategies
- Per asset
- Automatically

Currently tracking 15 cryptos + 5 stocks with individual optimized configs.

Open source: github.com/splinkjc-alt/gridbotchuck
```

### Post 3 - The Results Tease
```
Ran backtests on 15 cryptos.

Results:
- APT: +22.9% (1h, RSI+EMA)
- LINK: +17.9% (1h, RSI+BB)  
- SOL: +15.9% (1h, RSI+BB)

Each coin has its own optimal setup.

Open source. Python. Free.

### Post 1 - The Story
```
I got tired of trading bots that use the same settings for every coin.

BTC doesn't trade like DOGE. SOL doesn't trade like ADA.

So I built GridBot Chuck - an open-source Python trading bot that:

✅ Tests 60+ combinations per asset (timeframes, indicators, strategies)
✅ Finds the optimal config for EACH coin via backtesting
✅ Scans 20 assets simultaneously with individual settings
✅ Tracks signal accuracy to validate predictions

Currently paper trading on Kraken, watching 15 cryptos and 5 stocks.

The scanner found that:
- Some coins prefer 1h candles, others 30m
- Some work best with RSI+Bollinger, others RSI+EMA
- Grid strategy dominated across the board

It's all open source. Check it out:

Built with Python, ccxt, and a lot of late nights.

Trading bot that backtests 60 combos per coin and uses the winner. Open source. github.com/splinkjc-alt/gridbotchuck
```

```
Why use the same RSI settings for BTC and DOGE? They're different. My bot knows that. github.com/splinkjc-alt/gridbotchuck
