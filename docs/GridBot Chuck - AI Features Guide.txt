ENTRY SIGNAL SCORING (0-100):
- Price Position (40% weight): Prefers price near grid bottom (0-20%)
- RSI Indicator (30% weight): Prefers oversold conditions (RSI < 30)
- Volume Trend (10% weight): Prefers consolidation/stable volume
- Grid Suitability (20% weight): Uses pair scanner score

SIGNAL STRENGTH LEVELS:
- EXCELLENT (80+): Enters immediately regardless of rank
- GOOD (65-79): Strong entry signal, will enter
- MODERATE (50-64): Waits for better conditions
- WEAK (35-49): Poor entry timing
- POOR (<35): Avoids entry completely

SMART PRIORITIZATION:
1. EXCELLENT signals (any rank) - Best opportunities anywhere
2. Top 3 ranked pairs with GOOD+ signals - Proven performers
3. Others ranked by score - Backup opportunities

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
  Exchange: Kraken
  Monitoring: 10 pairs (BNB, DOGE, XRP, SOL, LTC, MATIC, ADA, ALGO, DOT, ATOM)
  Capital: $500 (5 positions × $100 each)
  Min Entry Score: 65

  Scan Cycle 1:
  - BNB/USDT: Score 60.5 (MODERATE) - Price at 24%, RSI 51 → WAIT
  - DOGE/USDT: Score 49.4 (WEAK) - Price at 28%, RSI 62 → WAIT
  - XRP/USDT: Score 52.3 (MODERATE) - Price at 37%, RSI 65 → WAIT
  → Bot waits 5 minutes for better conditions

  Scan Cycle 2:
  - BNB/USDT: Score 83.2 (EXCELLENT) - Price at 12%, RSI 28 → ENTER!
  - Position opened: $100 allocated, 4 positions remaining
  → Bot continues monitoring for 4 more opportunities

BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

SMART SCAN:
✓ Run scan daily to catch trending pairs
✓ Use 10-20 pairs for good coverage
✓ Higher volume = more reliable fills

AUTO-PORTFOLIO:
✓ Start with $500-1000 capital for 5 positions
✓ Monitor 10+ pairs for better opportunities
✓ Let it run 30-60 minutes minimum
✓ Be patient - good entries are worth waiting for
✓ Lower minimum score (55-60) for faster entries
✓ Higher minimum score (70+) for conservative approach

CAPITAL ALLOCATION:
- Small capital ($55): 2 pairs × $20-25 each
- Medium capital ($500): 5 pairs × $100 each
- Large capital ($5000): 10 pairs × $500 each


================================================================================
TECHNICAL INDICATORS EXPLAINED

RSI (Relative Strength Index):
- Measures momentum on scale of 0-100
- RSI < 30 = Oversold (good buy signal)
- RSI > 70 = Overbought (avoid entry)

Price Position:
